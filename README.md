## The Problem It Solves

We all start new, positive habits with great intentions, but keeping them is hard. The problem isn't a lack of desire; it's **friction**. Tracking important personal goals on scattered notes, phone reminders, or just in our heads is disorganized and works against us. This friction is what causes good habits to fail.

Prayer Ledger was designed from the ground up to eliminate that friction by providing a simple, beautiful, and dedicated system to focus on what matters.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architectural Principles

This project was built with a strong focus on professional development practices to ensure it is not only functional but also scalable, maintainable, and accessible.

#### üéØ Strategic & Focused MVP
The project began with a deep analysis of the core user problem, leading to a focused Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope. Every feature was intentionally chosen to solve the primary problem of "user friction" without adding unnecessary complexity.

#### üß± Clean & Maintainable Architecture
The codebase follows a strict **separation of concerns**.
* **UI Components (`/components`)** are distinct from **Routing & Pages (`/app`)**.
* **Business Logic & Database interactions (`/lib`)** are centralized, ensuring that the code is easy to read, debug, and scale in the future.

#### ‚ôø Accessibility as a Core Feature
Accessibility was not an afterthought. The application was built to be inclusive, following best practices such as:
* Semantic HTML.
* Proper use of `<label>` tags for all form inputs.
* Full keyboard navigability with clear focus indicators.
